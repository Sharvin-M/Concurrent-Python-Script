# Python Script That Accepts a Match Automatically When You Are in Queue

## How it works:

1.Takes a screen shot
2.Uses openCV match template function to find the accept button 3. Clicks on the button

I also made a github workflow to lint the python files when pushed to the repo using Ruff.

I made this tool so that I could refill my water while I was in queue without fear of dodging a match and being penalized.
