# Automatically accepts a match when in queue

I made this tool so that I could refill my water while I was in queue without fear of dodging a match and being penalized.

## How it works:

<<<<<<< HEAD
  1.Takes a screen shot\
  2.Uses openCV match template function to find the accept button\
  3. Clicks on the button

### Built using: OpenCV, PyAutoGui, NumPy, Git, and Github Actions.
I also made a github workflow to lint the python files when pushed to the repo using Ruff.
