# lolClientScript To Auto Accept Match When in Queue 

Automatically locates and clicks on Accept button when in queue so you don't have to worry about dodge timers from the queue popping whilst you are not there. 


#Basic Architecure: 

Py auto gui screen capture --> openCV match template determines if and where the accept button is --> if present click on it 


#Implemented my first DevOps feature using github actions:

automatically formats and lints code using Ruff when code is pushed
