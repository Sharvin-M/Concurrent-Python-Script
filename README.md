# Automatically accepts a match when in queue

I made this tool so that I could refill my water while I was in queue without fear of dodging a match and being penalized.

## How it works:

  1.Takes a screen shot\
  2.Uses openCV match template function to find the accept button\
  3. Clicks on the button

I also made a github workflow to lint the python files when pushed to the repo using Ruff.
